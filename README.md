## 🚀 Killer Features

### 🛡️ MutationGate

**Stop risky mutations before they happen.**
MutationGate provides a hard gate for file system changes. It intercepts, warns, and blocks unauthorized or risky mutations, especially during release orchestration. No more accidental deletions or unauthorized config changes.
(릴리즈 오케스트레이션 시 변조를 차단하거나 허용하는 강력한 게이트웨이입니다. 위험한 파일 시스템 변경을 사전에 방지합니다.)

### ⚖️ ProofGate

**Evidence-backed verification, claim judge.**
ProofGate requires machine-generated evidence (test results, build logs, etc.) for every claim an agent makes. It acts as a judge to verify that a task was actually completed correctly, not just "claimed" to be done.
(에이전트의 주장을 증거 기반으로 검증합니다. 테스트 결과, 빌드 로그 등 객체적 증거를 통해 작업 완료 여부를 심판합니다.)

## The Problem

Agent hosts like Claude Code and Codex are powerful but lack governance, mutation safety, and evidence-backed verification. They often operate in a "trust me" mode where changes happen without a clear audit trail or safety gates. This leads to risky mutations, lack of interoperability between different agent stacks, and difficulty in verifying that a task was actually completed correctly.

## The Solution

OMG (Oh My God) provides a governance and orchestration layer that sits on top of existing agent hosts. It introduces:

- **Hooks**: Pre-tool and post-tool execution gates for security and validation.
- **Governance Payload**: Structured metadata for every action.
- **Mutation Gate**: Prevents or warns about risky file system changes.
- **Session Health**: Monitors the state of the session and requires review for risky states.
- **Forge**: A modular orchestration engine for complex tasks.
- **Memory**: A secure, namespaced, and encrypted state store.
- **Evidence-Backed Verification**: Machine-generated proof for every claim.

## Real-World Example

Imagine an agent trying to delete a critical configuration file. Without OMG, the agent might just do it. With OMG's **Mutation Gate**, the action is intercepted, a warning is generated, and the user is prompted for approval. Or, when an agent claims a feature is "done", OMG's **Claim Judge** and **Proof Gate** require actual test results and build logs as evidence before the claim is accepted.

## Architecture

OMG operates as a middleware layer between the agent host and the underlying tools.

```

## Limitations

- **Not a Base Model**: OMG does not train or provide its own LLMs; it orchestrates existing ones.
- **Local-Only**: Designed for same-machine production; no cloud-sync for state by design.
- **Advisory-First**: In v1, many gates are advisory (warnings) rather than hard-blocking to avoid breaking workflows.
- **Host Dependent**: Capabilities are limited by what the underlying agent host supports.

## Why OMG

<!-- OMG:GENERATED:why-omg -->

OMG keeps the host you already use, then adds governed install, proof, and release surfaces on top.

- Canonical host parity targets are Claude, Codex, Gemini, and Kimi.
- OpenCode remains a supported compatibility host for teams that need it.
- Install and verification stay explicit: doctor first, preview second, apply last.

> Legacy Claude compatibility commands such as `/OMG:setup` and `/OMG:crazy <goal>` remain documented as footnotes only.

<!-- /OMG:GENERATED:why-omg -->

- Claude front door: run `npx omg env doctor`, then `npx omg install --plan`, then `npx omg install --apply`.
- Browser front door: run `/OMG:browser <goal>` for browser automation and verification, with `/OMG:playwright` kept as a compatibility alias and the upstream Playwright CLI handling browser execution.
- Multi-host support: Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, and Kimi CLI are canonical behavior-parity hosts; OpenCode is compatibility-only.
- Compiled planning: advanced planning is now compiled into the `plan-council` bundle for deterministic execution.
- Native adoption: setup detects OMC, OMX, and Superpowers-style environments without exposing copycat public migration commands.
- Proof-first delivery: verification, provider coverage, HUD artifacts, and transcripts are published instead of implied.

## Canonical Contract

OMG now ships a production control-plane contract and generated host artifacts. Same-machine production support is anchored by the stdio-first `omg-control` MCP. HTTP control-plane exposure is intended for development and local HUD use only.

- Normative spec: `OMG_COMPAT_CONTRACT.md`
- Executable registry: `registry/omg-capability.schema.json` and `registry/bundles/*.yaml`
- Generated Codex pack: `.agents/skills/omg/`
- Validation: `npx omg contract validate`
- Compilation: `npx omg contract compile --host claude --host codex --host gemini --host kimi --channel public`
- Release gate: `npx omg release readiness --channel dual`

![OMG HUD](docs/assets/omg-hud.svg)

## Quickstart

<!-- OMG:GENERATED:install-intro -->

> **Prerequisites**: macOS or Linux, Node >=18, Python >=3.10

```bash
# interactive first-time setup (doctor → plan → confirm → apply)
npx omg init

# CI/automation path (non-interactive)
npx omg install --apply
npx omg ship
```

Local package-manager installs only link `omg` into `node_modules/.bin/`; they do not mutate configuration.

For CI/automation, use `npx omg install --apply` directly.

<!-- /OMG:GENERATED:install-intro -->

On non-Claude hosts, verify native MCP registration after `npx omg install --apply`:

- `codex mcp list`
- `gemini mcp list`
- `kimi mcp list`

Success looks like:

- supported hosts are detected
- Claude Code sees `omg@omg` as enabled instead of `failed to load`
- Claude Code's plugin bundle owns `omg-control` via `.claude-plugin/mcp.json`; project or user `.mcp.json` entries can keep `filesystem` without collisions
- `~/.claude/settings.json` has a `statusLine` command for `~/.claude/hud/omg-hud.mjs`
- `~/.codex/config.toml`, `~/.gemini/settings.json`, and `~/.kimi/mcp.json` receive `omg-control` after `npx omg install --apply` when those CLIs are on `PATH`
- additional MCP servers are added when a broader preset is selected (`standard` adds `context7`; `full` adds `websearch` and `omg-memory`; `experimental` adds browser automation)
- `.omg/state/adoption-report.json` is written when another ecosystem is present
- OMG reports the selected preset and next step
- narrowed defaults keep the required control plane small while optional capabilities such as browser automation remain opt-in

> Restricted environments / air-gapped fallback only: clone-and-setup flows plus Claude slash commands such as `/OMG:setup` and `/OMG:crazy <goal>` remain available when launcher-first install cannot modify the host directly.

## Claude Marketplace Install

Install OMG via Claude Code's plugin marketplace:

```bash
# Add OMG marketplace
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/trac3r00/OMG

# Install OMG core
/plugin install omg@omg

# Or use claude mcp add for direct MCP installation
claude mcp add omg npx @trac3r/oh-my-god
```

After installation, OMG's governance, orchestration, and skill system are available:

- **Universal skills**: `@governance`, `@orchestrate`, `@memory`, `@proof`, `@forge`
- **Provider skills**: Claude (`@claude/*`), Codex (`@codex/*`), OpenCode (`@opencode/*`), Gemini (`@gemini/*`)
- **Registry**: `registry/skills.json` lists all available skills

## Native Adoption

OMG uses native setup language instead of public migration commands.

- `OMG-only`: recommended. OMG becomes the primary hooks, HUD, MCP, and orchestration layer.
- `coexist`: advanced. OMG preserves non-conflicting third-party surfaces and records overlap instead of overwriting it.
- Modes: `chill`, `focused`, `exploratory`. `focused` is the production default.
- Presets: `minimal`, `standard`, `full`, `experimental`, `production` (`safe`, `balanced`, `interop`, `labs`, and `buffet` still work with deprecation warnings).

## Security Notes

- The shipped `minimal` preset now registers pre-tool security hooks before the planning helper.
- `Bash` requests are screened by `firewall.py`, and file reads or edits are screened by `secret-guard.py`.
- Raw environment dumps, interpreters, and permission-changing commands such as `env`, `node`, `python`, `python3`, `chmod`, and `chown` now require approval instead of being silently allowed.

Compatibility references to OMC, OMX, and Superpowers are documented here: [docs/migration/native-adoption.md](docs/migration/native-adoption.md)

## Positioning

OMG is a plugin and orchestration layer for supported CLIs. It is not a base-model training project. The goal is to make frontier agent hosts tighter, safer, more interoperable, and more verifiable than the default experience.
